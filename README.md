# CMAQ Adjoint Bogota Case Study <br>Sumpplementary material </font> 

This is the repository for the supplementary material used in the work Application of advanced sensitivity tools in atmospheric models: The CMAQ Adjoin applied to the case of Bogota. Here are listed the different tools and guides developed to integrate all the data processor programs and models used to run the [CMAQ Adjoint v5.0](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/13/2925/2020/).

**Disclaimer:** The tools listed here were developed to run cross-platform in a Linux CentOS 7 server and macOS BigSur laptop, both with Intel® CPU's. The language versions and libraries used for the environments of each of these tools are described in the guides below. There was **no testing** of any extent made for implementing the codes in another system.

## Installation guide

This is the [CMAQ Adjoint Installation Guide](https://github.com/kamitoteles/CMAQ_ADJ_Installation). In the repositoy is a comlplete guide on how to install the main model used in the investigation.

## Process flow chart
This is the flow chart describing the process the user may follow to implement eh CMA Adjoint preprocessors and model.
